"""Resume versions, user verification, change history and the Evidence Bank link.

    Structured field → user verifies → VerifiedEvidence (Evidence, source="resume") created or updated

Rules this module enforces:
* Resume versions are never overwritten. An upload or new master text is a new version; re-uploading the same
  file reuses its version.
* One selection: the active version (Resume.is_active). Only set_active changes it, and only because the person
  asked; uploads and edits never do (a profile's very first resume is the one exception). The profile's master
  text and the library's active file are mirrors of it that set_active keeps in step.
* Every workflow resolves its resume through selected / for_job: the job's own resume, else the active one, in
  the form the candidate policy's resume source names (structured data, or the raw text as written).
* Only the user verifies. Every unit starts UNVERIFIED; editing a VERIFIED or REJECTED unit makes it EDITED and
  a VERIFIED resume NEEDS_REVIEW until it is verified again.
* A parser never overwrites data a person reviewed or edited: re-parsing produces a comparison that the user
  resolves value by value. The AI structuring of a new upload (app.services.resume_parsing) fills the data only while
  nobody has reviewed or edited it.
* Evidence is created only from VERIFIED bullets under a VERIFIED role or project. Anything else that had
  evidence has it marked unverified (never deleted, so rankings that cited it stay explainable).
* Every change is written to ResumeDataChange with its source (PARSER, USER, SYSTEM).
