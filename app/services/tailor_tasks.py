"""Background tailoring: single-job and bulk tailoring run as database-backed tasks that survive page reloads.

Queueing a job writes a `tailor_tasks` row and returns at once. An in-process worker, started with the app,
claims queued tasks with a conditional UPDATE (so two app instances never run the same task), runs them in
threads, and records the stage each one is in (ranking, tailoring, reviewing). The Tailor screen polls the
task list to show that progress.

A task whose worker died mid-run (a restart or deploy) is left holding an expired lease. The next claim puts
it back in the queue, and fails it once it has been interrupted MAX_ATTEMPTS times.
