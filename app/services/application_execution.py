"""The application execution worker's queue (Phase 5): enqueue, claim, run, settle, wait for a person, kill, retry.

    POST /api/jobs/{id}/application-execution → enqueue (refused unless the packet is ready to apply to: the shared
                                                apply_queue rules, the approved digest captured on the task)
    the `application_execution` scheduler job → claim (SKIP LOCKED + guarded UPDATE) → process: start or resume the
                                                task's graph thread (app.agents.application) and settle the task
    a person answers or confirms              → wake: the waiting task becomes claimable again

APPLICATION_EXECUTION_MODE (off by default) chooses what a run may do: `observe` reads the form and resolves where
each answer comes from; `assist` also fills it in an ephemeral browser page and validates it, ending READY_TO_SUBMIT,
and a person submits (in the kept browser window, or on the site). `guarded_auto` (Phase 6, auto submit) lets a run
of an account that turned Auto submit on submit the application itself, on any route a browser can complete — only
through app.services.submission, holding the shared claim and a SubmissionIntent — and queues that run when the job is
approved (`on_approved`). The submit stages (SUBMITTING,
CONFIRMING, CONFIRMED) are refused here (`set_stage`) unless that intent is passed, and by the column otherwise.

PostgreSQL is the only queue. Waiting for a person uses no attempt and no polling: a task waiting at NEEDS_INPUT is
not claimable until a person answers or confirms (or asks to Run now). Kill stops the task and its thread; nothing
revives it until a person asks (Retry and Run now queue a new task).
