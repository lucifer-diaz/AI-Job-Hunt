"""The Job Insights research queue: one active task per job, claimed with a lease, retried with backoff.

    approval (workflow.approve_job) ─┐
    Find insights / Refresh (API)   ─┼→ JobInsightTask PENDING   ← nothing here waits for research
    backlog sweep (approved jobs)   ─┘        ↓ scheduler job `job_insights` (scheduled_jobs.run_live)
                                         claim (SKIP LOCKED + guarded UPDATE) → service.process

The same claim, lease and run-now rules as JD recovery (app.services.jd_recovery): two app instances never hold the
same task, a task whose worker died is retried or failed once its attempts are used, and every write after a network
or model call checks the lease first (`held`).
