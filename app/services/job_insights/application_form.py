"""Application-form preparation on Job Insights: what to write for the questions an ATS form asks.

    pasted questions (application_form_input) ─┐
                                               ├→ before the model: the person's verified library answer wins,
    a full research run predicts more ─────────┘   a personal question (visa, salary, notice, …) needs the person
          → the candidate's context (context_builder.build_application_form_context): the job's own resume (verified
            roles, bullets with their evidence ids, projects, skills, education), the profile's headline and verified
            summary, and for each pasted question its own retrieval — verified evidence (RAG when it is on) and
            similar verified saved answers — inside the job's resume scope
          → one APPLICATION_ANSWER call (prompt `application_form`, through the LLM gateway) with the structured JD, the
            fit analysis, that context, verified non-sensitive saved answers and a company summary
          → after the model, item by item: ids it was not shown drop that item; a personal question loses its draft;
            a draft must pass the screening-answer grounding checks (tailoring_results.check_prose) or needs input
          → job_insights.application_questions (merged with the last good drafts)

A draft is a suggestion. Nothing here writes a KnowledgeAnswer: the person saves an answer in the Answer library, and
marks it verified there. Runs inside a claimed research task (a full run, or an APPLICATION_FORM task queued when the
person pastes questions), never in a request.
